# EndToEndTests

This project contains browser-based end-to-end tests using Playwright for .NET.

## What this covers

- Run browser tests against the real app URL (`https://localhost:5001`) started by the fixture.
- Keep tests readable with role/text/test-id locators and page helpers.
- Use Playwright codegen as a draft, then refactor for maintainability.

## First-time setup

1. Build the project to generate the Playwright install script:

   dotnet build tests/EndToEndTests/EndToEndTests.csproj

2. Install browser binaries:

   pwsh tests/EndToEndTests/bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 install

## Run tests

dotnet test tests/EndToEndTests/EndToEndTests.csproj

The smoke test starts the Web app automatically using its normal launch profile (<https://localhost:5001>), loads the home page, and validates seeded catalog data is rendered.

## Track 1: Codegen to cleaned test workflow

1. Generate a first draft test:

   pwsh tests/EndToEndTests/bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 codegen <https://localhost:5001>

2. Paste the generated code into a test file as a draft.

3. Refactor the draft into maintainable tests:

   - Prefer `GetByRole`, `GetByText`, and `GetByTestId` locators.
   - Remove brittle CSS/XPath selectors when possible.
   - Keep assertions focused on user-visible behavior.
   - Extract page helpers only when they improve readability.

4. Compare examples in this repo:

   - `Playwright/SmokeTests.cs` for a minimal baseline scenario.
   - `Playwright/CatalogTests.cs` and `Playwright/Pages/CatalogPage.cs` for intent-revealing helper usage.

## Level 1 demo script: codegen draft to artifact-producing run

Use this walkthrough when teaching the full authoring loop. It intentionally ends with a failing run so Level 2 can inspect real artifacts.

1. Build and install browsers (first run only):

   dotnet build tests/EndToEndTests/EndToEndTests.csproj
   pwsh tests/EndToEndTests/bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 install

2. Generate a draft with Playwright codegen:

   pwsh tests/EndToEndTests/bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 codegen <https://localhost:5001>

3. In the codegen browser, perform this short flow:

   - Open home page.
   - Click the first `Add to Basket` button.
   - Click `Basket`.
   - Confirm a basket line item is visible.

4. Save generated output as a draft and clean it:

   - Keep a copy of generated draft code for comparison.
   - Refactor selectors toward `GetByRole`/`GetByText`/`GetByTestId`.
   - Keep assertions user-visible and intent-based.

5. Enable the intentional failure demo test in `Playwright/BasketTests.cs`:

   - Remove the `Skip` value from `Cart_AddItem_ShowsExpectedTotal`.

6. Run only the intentional failure test:

   dotnet test tests/EndToEndTests/EndToEndTests.csproj --filter FullyQualifiedName~BasketTests.Cart_AddItem_ShowsExpectedTotal

7. Verify artifacts were produced under:

   - `TestResults/PlaywrightArtifacts/<test-name>-<timestamp>/failure.png`
   - `TestResults/PlaywrightArtifacts/<test-name>-<timestamp>/trace.zip`
   - `TestResults/PlaywrightArtifacts/<test-name>-<timestamp>/video/`

8. Reset the failure test to keep default suite green:

   - Restore the `Skip` value after the demo.

This completes Level 1 and provides concrete artifacts for Level 2 analysis/refactor/diagnostics practice.

## Track 2: Debugging with traces, screenshots, and video

This repo includes an intentionally failing basket test scenario in `Playwright/BasketTests.cs`.

- It is skip-enabled by default to keep normal test runs green.
- Remove the test `Skip` value when you want to run the failure demo.

### Artifact output behavior

- Artifacts are written to `TestResults/PlaywrightArtifacts/<test-name>-<timestamp>/`.
- Failure screenshot path: `failure.png`
- Failure trace path: `trace.zip`
- Video output path: `video/`

### Run and inspect

1. Run tests:

   dotnet test tests/EndToEndTests/EndToEndTests.csproj

2. Optional: produce structured test result output:

   dotnet test tests/EndToEndTests/EndToEndTests.csproj --logger "trx;LogFileName=endtoend.trx"

3. Open trace locally with Playwright:

   pwsh tests/EndToEndTests/bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 show-trace TestResults/PlaywrightArtifacts/<folder>/trace.zip

4. Or open trace in hosted viewer:

   - Go to <https://trace.playwright.dev>
   - Upload `trace.zip`

Trace Viewer helps diagnose failures by showing action timeline, DOM snapshots, console/network details, and screenshots.

### Important note on visual comparisons

Screenshots/videos here are artifacts from the failed execution. For true visual comparison against a previous baseline, add screenshot assertions and baselines or integrate a dedicated visual testing tool/service.

## Track 3: Designing meaningful browser tests

Use Playwright to verify the system is wired together correctly from the user perspective, not to exhaustively prove every business rule.

### Bad strategy vs better strategy

- Bad strategy: test every business rule combination through browser flows.
- Better strategy: keep critical user journeys in Playwright and move rule permutations to unit, integration, or API tests.

### eShopOnWeb scenario categories

- Smoke scenario (browser): home page loads and seeded catalog data is visible.
- Critical journey (browser): add item to basket and verify user-visible basket outcome.
- Fragile legacy candidate (browser, temporary): high-value flow with unstable selectors while UI is being modernized.

### AI-assisted Level 3 workflow script

Use this script to demonstrate an agent-assisted authoring loop with human review gates.

1. Ask an agent to explore catalog and basket flows in the running app and summarize candidate testable user journeys.
2. Ask the agent to propose 3-5 candidate scenarios and classify each as smoke, critical journey, or better suited for lower-level tests.
3. Ask the agent to draft one Playwright C# test for a selected scenario.
4. Human review/edit before run:
   - Confirm user intent is preserved.
   - Replace brittle selectors with role/text/test-id locators.
   - Ensure assertions are user-observable.
5. Run targeted test(s):

   dotnet test tests/EndToEndTests/EndToEndTests.csproj --filter FullyQualifiedName~CatalogTests

6. If failure occurs, inspect generated artifacts (`failure.png`, `trace.zip`, `video/`) under `TestResults/PlaywrightArtifacts/`.
7. Ask the agent to diagnose using failing assertion details and trace/artifact observations.
8. Apply minimal fix, rerun targeted tests, then run broader suite.
